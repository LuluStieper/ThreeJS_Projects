# ThreeJS_Projects

This repository contains a collection of three interactive projects I developed using Three.js. Each project demonstrates my ability to create engaging 3D visualizations and interactive experiences on the web. Although these projects are not hosted online, the relevant source code and visual representations are provided to give insight into my design and development process. Please note that all of these projects are unfinished, as I created them to experiment with Three.js in my free time.
