# threejs-projects

This repository contains a collection of three-dimensional interactive projects I developed using Three.js. Although these projects are not hosted online, the relevant source code and visual representations are provided to give insight into my design and development process. Please note that all of these projects are unfinished, as I created them to experiment with Three.js in my free time.
