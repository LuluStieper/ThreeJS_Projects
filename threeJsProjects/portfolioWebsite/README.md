This is a three-dimensional portfolio website I developed as an exercise a few months ago. 
While I didn't manage to fully finish or polish it yet, the core functionalities are working quite well.
Users can navigate through the 3D world by dragging left and right, creating a circular motion around the scene.
The island (the scene) moves in response to user input, enhancing the immersive experience.
Added to that, a little car moves along designated checkpoints, guiding users through various content displays.
It is fully responsive as well.
Working on this project has definitly expanded my knowledge of Three.js and basics of computer graphics concepts.
