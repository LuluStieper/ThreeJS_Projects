In this project, I experimented with animating and manipulating a Blender model in Three.js. 
I implemented smooth camera transitions around the model, animated the car’s wheels in Blender, 
and integrated these animations into the scene. I also experimented with changing the model’s surface 
to a wireframe style to create a unique visual effect.

Additionally, I added particle effects to simulate speed and motion within the scene. 
This project was purely for fun and learning more about Three.js and advanced visual effects.
